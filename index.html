<h1>Liam Davis</h1>
<div class="about"><h2>About me</h2><p>I enjoy discovery, problem solving, and competition.  I would describe myself as curious, realistic, and reasonably competent.  Professionally, I aim to work in cybersecurity, preferably in some military or otherwise defense-adjacent capacity, such that I know what I'm doing is of immediate and measurable importance.</p></div>
